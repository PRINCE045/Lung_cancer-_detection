Lung Cancer Detection Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting Lung Cancer based on a survey dataset of various symptoms and risk factors.

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore a dataset related to lung cancer, perform data preprocessing, visualize relationships between features, and build a classification model to predict the presence of lung cancer.

The primary steps involved are:


Data Loading and Exploration: Understanding the structure and initial characteristics of the dataset .




Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical features (like 'GENDER' and 'LUNG_CANCER') using Label Encoding and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler .



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and correlations .






Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model .




Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using key classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) and a Confusion Matrix .





üíæ Dataset Details
The dataset contains 309 entries and 16 columns.

üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps in the EDA included:

Target Imbalance: A countplot showed a higher count for LUNG_CANCER=1 compared to LUNG_CANCER=0.


Age Distribution: The age distribution was visualized using a histogram.



Correlation Heatmap: A correlation heatmap of numerical features was generated.

üß† Machine Learning Models and Results
The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a test_size of approximately 20% (X_train shape: (247, 15), X_test shape: (62, 15)) .

1. Logistic Regression
The model was trained on scaled features (X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled) .
